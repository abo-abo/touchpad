* Introduction
I often make a mess touching the touchpad with my palms as I touch
type.  On the other hand, I tend to work without a USB mouse and
sometimes need the touchpad.  Furthermore, my current work laptop
(Dell 5510) in spite of a hefty price tag doesn't feature a hardware
touchpad toggle.

Solution: provide a simple shell command to toggle the touchpad state:
#+begin_src sh
tt
#+end_src

* Installing
Install system-wide:
#+begin_src sh
sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade touchpad
#+end_src

The package depends on =xinput= to do all the work:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install xinput
#+end_src
